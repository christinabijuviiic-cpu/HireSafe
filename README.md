### Project Description
[The Internship and Job Scam Prevention System is a project designed to protect students and job seekers from fake job and internship offers. It verifies company details, detects suspicious job postings using basic analysis or AI, and allows users to report scams. The system helps reduce financial fraud and increases awareness about online recruitment scams.]

### The Problem statement

These scams often involve fake companies, requests for payment, or misuse of personal information, leading to financial loss and identity theft. There is a need for a reliable system that can verify job postings and help users identify and prevent internship and job-related scams.]
